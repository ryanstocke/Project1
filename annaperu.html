                <p>
                    WOW. Where to even begin. My trip to Peru was second to none and I am so excited to
                    tell you guys all about it! Each sight was more beautiful than the last and I gained
                    an entirely new appreciation for this beautiful Earth that we call home. In this blog post,
                    I will go day by day and explain the activities and sights we witnessed in beautiful Peru
                    with Backroads, the World's #1 Most Active Travel Company.</p>

                <p>Days 1-2: My family arrived in Cusco, Peru. We immediately felt the elevation gain (11,152 ft),
                    but luckily I came from Denver so the shift wasn't too major. It was a lot more apparent for my
                    family traveling
                    in from sea level. We were picked up at the airport and taken on a beautiful hour and a half drive
                    through the Sacred Valley to our first hotel.
                    While in the car, we learned all about the agriculture of the area and the delicacies (guinea pig,
                    anyone?) We walked through the
                    Pisac Market, ate empanadas, took photos with the locals, and even held a baby Llama. We ended
                    the day in our gorgeous hotel in the heart of the Sacred Valley, and enjoyed dinner and each
                    other's company. </p>
                <img class="llama" src='assets/images/DSC_7597.jpeg'>
                <p>Days 2-3: After our stay in the Sacred Valley, we headed back to Cusco to meet our guides and the
                    other travelers
                    that we would be spending the next 8 days with on our hike from Salkantay to Machu Picchu. We
                    arrived at the Hotel Monasterio,
                    which used to be a monastery for Catholic munks. It was a beautiful hotel in the heart of the city,
                    and the next two days were spent
                    getting to know one another, as well as acclimating ot the altitude, as we would soon be reaching
                    15,900 ft when we summit Salkantay. Backroads
                    did a very good job of preparing all the body types for the big hike that lay ahead. During one of
                    our acclimation hikes, we had the pleasure of
                    hiking with a 90 year old Farmer and her pack of llamas and alpacas. To say I was peaking would be
                    an understatement...
                </p>
                <img class="humantay" src='assets/images/DSC_7895.jpeg'>
                <p>Day 4-6: Finally the day had arrived--the day we would sit in a car for 4 hours and arrive at the
                    trailhead to embark on our 8 day trek from the Andes Mountains,
                    to the base of the Amazon, arriving at Machu Picchu. After about 4 miles we reached Soraypampa and
                    witnessed the breathtaking mountain and valley vistas. (If
                    A couple miles after that, we rounded a corner and got
                    our first spectacular look of Humantay Mountain.
                    When we reached the lodge, we saw our first peak of 20,500‐foot, glacier‐covered
                    Salkantay Peak, Inca mythology's most sacred
                    mountain. It was absolutely breathtaking. We arrived at our lodge and relaxed the rest of the
                    night, even drank some Pisco Sours (an egg white based alcoholic beverage that is extremely popular
                    in Peru).
                    We woke up early the next day and began our hike through Soraypampa past modest mountain homes
                    and up to a glacial lake at the base of Humantay
                    Mountain. We had the amazing opportunity to hike with Peruvian priests who come from an extremely
                    remote village. They
                    spoke no English and hiked in sandals, which was quite the sight on the snow capped mountains. They
                    performed a ceremony
                    on the mountain with the panoramic view of Humantay lake and the mountains. I honestly do not have
                    words to describe
                    how humbling and emotional this experience was, and I am so thankful to have had that experience. I
                    can safely say that it was one of the most
                    beautiful things I have ever experienced.
                </p>
                <img class = "salkantay" src= "assets/images/DSC_8008.jpeg">
                <p>Day 5: This was the big day! We geared up early for an exhilarating
                        high‐altitude trek to Huayraccmachay via Salkantay
                        Pass. After breakfast, we began hiking up the Río Blanco
                        Valley, circling the vaulting Humantay Peak. We spent the full morning making our way to
                        the pass. As the elevation rose and rose, it became harder for some in the group
                        to keep up and many breaks were taken. When we finally reached the pass, we saw the thousands of apachetas (small stone
                        markers) left by pilgrims as spiritual offerings to
                        Pachamama (or "Mother Earth") for a good trek and
                        good health. We reached Incachiriaska, the
                        highest point on the trail and the pass at 15,190 feet, we saw stunning views of the Vilcabamba Range and
                        the towering southern face of Mount Salkantay. It was such an accomplishment, and everyone was in great 
                        spirits. Really cool moment on the trip! </p>

                <p>Day 6-7: The next few days were spent transitioning from the mountain peaks of Salkantay, to the jungle, humid
                    air of entering the Amazon. We spent our days hiking through forest and seeing amazing plants and animals.
                    We had a great time enjoying each other's company, eating delicious food, and gearing up to see the main site of this trip: Machu Picchu.

                <img class = "picchu" src='assets/images/DSC_8534.jpeg'>
                <p>Day 8: The day finally came, the wonder of the world that the entire trip was based around: Machu Picchu. David (my brother) and I got up very early to 
                    go with Nice for an early look and stair-stepper challenge of Machu Picchu Mountain. The journey to the top made for an incredible
                    photo opportunity and insane, almost birds-eye-view of the ruins. We met up with the rest of the group afterwards, and spent the rest of the morning
                    admiring the painstakingly restored masonry, relishing the incredible views and explore highlights (including the Inca
                    Drawbridge), learning from a local expert who provided insight into the
                    astrological designs created by the sun‐worshipping
                    Inca, the exquisite stonework of the temples and
                    other structures, and the fascinating story of Machu
                    Picchu's discovery. ​It was an amazing day, and it was extremely cool to watch 
                    my dad, who has wanted to see Machu Picchu for as long as I can remember. It was such a 
                    special day and trip.
                </p>
                    <p>This trip was back in May, and I still remember it so vivdly. It has been so fun to be able to 
                        reminisce on the memories from this unforgettable experience, while also being able to showcase
                        what I have been learning in this coding bootcamp. I am excited to showcase more of my skills as the 
                        months go on, and share with you all my traveling stories and hopefully, inspire you all to travel to different
                        areas of the world.
